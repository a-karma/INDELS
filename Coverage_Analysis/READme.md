Firstly, we need to create two input files for bedtools to calculate coverage.
The first one (termed Can_Fam_bedtools_genome_file.txt) contains the chromosome sizes of our reference genome (canFam3.1).
The second one (termed chr6_target.bed) is a tab separated file in bed format (Browser Extensible Data) which contains info about the regions of interest.
